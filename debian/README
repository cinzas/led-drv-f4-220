The Debian Package led-drv-f4-220
----------------------------

This is a linux driver for LED status lights of the TerraMaster F4-220.
It was created looking at the binary of the driver module from TerraMaster.
I later found there is now a GPL source version provided by TerraMaster at
https://www.terra-master.com/code/led_drv_1800.c .
